Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I remember the tkinter exercises. Those definitely taught me about functions. 
By calling in functions that do circles, one can easily make clouds by just changing parameters.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are helpful to make sure that your code is working properly. 
This helps you debug your code as well in case your tests fail. 
The results will show you what went wrong. No need to examine a lot of lines.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

My process for troubleshooting and fixing a program is to check for squiggly lines, 
run the program and read the error message, and create test functions. 
What I can do to improve is to create a process flow first,
so I don't just randomly plug in code that will be confusing to debug.
