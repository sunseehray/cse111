CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Meal Planner

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

This program will help generate a meal plan for a week based on a given
start date.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

I will learn about how to extract information from a list. I will also
learn how to sort that information into different meals and schedules.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

I will use datetime, pytest, and random. I might also use csv if I will
place my list in a csv file.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

Yes. I will separate them into functions performing a single task.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

Yes. I will write test functions to test at least two of my program functions.
